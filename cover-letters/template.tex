To Whom It May Concern,

%I am writing to express my interest in applying to \textbf{something} at Mozilla.  As a premier company in the online technology space, Mozilla provides an unparalleled opportunity to contribute meaningfully to how people experience the web.  In particular, Mozilla's guiding open source principles position it uniquely apart from other profit-driven hegemons it competes with.  I have recently become involved in the open source community with my work this past summer for a Google Summer of Code project, so I am already comfortable and familiar with this ethos.  Further, my experience with web technologies in general makes me a

%I am writing to express my interest in joining the Private Fund Group (PFG) at Credit Suisse. As the premier placement agent for private capital, the PFG provides an unparalleled opportunity to develop relationships with the world's leading financial sponsors and investors. In my current role in Equity Research Sales, I have analyzed and evaluated public security investment decisions. I would be able to transfer these skills to private investments in the PFG. I would also learn about the investments decisions of the groups from which we are raising money. Understanding alternative investment managers, the process of marketing funds, and the companies in which they are investing are the reasons I am interested in this Analyst position.

%I have strong qualifications for the Analyst role in the PFG. I am extremely motivated and organized. These qualities have enabled me to successfully cover clients independently, and I am confident that these traits would be even better utilized in the PFG to create marketing materials, plan roadshows, and handle deadlines. I have a demonstrated record of peer leadership -- I was chosen as a leader of my Analyst Class, and I held leadership positions in collegiate academic and athletic endeavors. Additionally, I have strong quantitative analysis skills that I do not believe have been fully utilized in my current position.

%As the only Analyst in the Multi-Asset Group (MAG), I know how to work independently and efficiently to accomplish whatever task is asked of me. I have had to learn very quickly to handle incoming client requests and deliver results that exceed expectations. I also greatly enjoy working as part of a team, which is often required for covering the largest accounts on the MAG desk. I believe my skills and experiences would make me a positive contributor to the PFG from my first day on the desk.

%Further examples of my leadership and work experience are listed on my resume that accompanies this letter. I would love the opportunity to bring my motivation, hard work, and desire to succeed to the PFG.

Best regards,\\
Kevin Murphy
